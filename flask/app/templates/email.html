        <span style="font-size: 14px;">Dear Customer,&nbsp;<br/></span>
        <br/>        
        <span style="font-size: 14px;">Thank you for using our Sales Planner. Your results are attached to this email as an Excel file.&nbsp;<br/></span>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 14px;">For each site, we have presented costs based on your estimated usage for the site (e.g. if you estimated usage at 0.5 GB for a site, pricing <br/>
          would be for a 0.5GB package). For sites which have usage above a certain threshold (e.g. 200GB), or if you don't have any usage data, we have <br/>
          returned pricing based on an unlimited package.&nbsp;<br/></span>
          <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 14px;">We also have presented variations based on 4G cat 4, 4G cat 6, or 5G, and varying term lengths.<br/></span>
        <br/>
        <span style="font-size: 14px;">We have prepared some cost comparisons, based on the cheapest appropriate package versus a typical SoGEA cost. Please see below:<br/></span>
